 * Design decision for Collection:
 * The collection of football teams is modelled as a list because teams must be
 * stored alphabetically, searched by team name, traversed for reports, and added
 * as new teams are encountered in the data file.
 *
 * A linked list is used as the underlying data structure because the number of
 * teams is treated as unknown from the design information and ordered insertion
 * can be performed without shifting array elements.
